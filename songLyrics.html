            Diese kleine unheimliche Insel hat mich zu einer Waffe gemacht
            Wir glauben beide-
            Cette petite île étrange a fait de moi une arme
            Nous croyons tous les deux que nous pouvons l'utiliser

            Pour changer l'élan de cette guerre
            Esta pequeña isla misteriosa me ha convertido en un arma
            Ambos creemos que podemos usarla
            Para cambiar el impulso de esta guerra

            Welcome back to Trench
            Welcome back to Trench

            I created this world
            To feel some control
            Destroy it if I want
            So I sing, "Sahlo
            Folina
            Sahlo folina"

            Wait, what? Wait, what?
            Wait, what? Wait, what?

            Earned my stripes, 300 tracks in my Adidas track jacket
            Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
            Gobsmacked, don't hesitate
            But maybe overcompensate

            I feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes
            Don't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twice
            In the same night and won't hesitate
            To maybe overcompensate

            I said, I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)
            Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
            And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)
            Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

            Where I'm from, I was born right here, just now
            Originated right in front of your eyes
            If you can't see, I am Clancy, prodigal son
            Done running, come up with Josh Dun, wanted dead or alive

            So now you pick who you serve, you bow to the masses
            Get kicked to the curb for passin' the classes
            Half empty, half full, save half for your taxes
            Then overtake your former self

            I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)
            Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
            And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)
            Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

            Days feel like a perfect length, I don't need 'em any longer
            But for goodness sake, do the years seem
            Way too short for my soul, corazón?
            Way too short for my soul, corazón

            Days feel like a perfect length, I don't need them any longer
            But for goodness' sake, do the years seem
            Way too short for my soul, corazón?
            Way too short for my soul, corazón

            Earned my stripes, 300 tracks in my Adidas track jacket
            Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
            Gobsmacked, don't hesitate
            To maybe overcompensate

            I said, I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)
            Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
            And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)
            Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
